For the level0, we have one binery file.
We open with gdb and disassemble main function.
we see at main + 25, the first comparison with return of atoi and 0x1a7.
atoi take the fist argument of the programme.
0x1a7 = 423
So let start the programme with 423:

level0@RainFall:~$ ./level0 423
$ whoami
level1
$

We have a level1 shell, let cat .pass file.

$ cat /home/user/level1/.pass
